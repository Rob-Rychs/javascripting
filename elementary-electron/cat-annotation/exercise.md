# Cat Annotation

Now we're going to add a feature: draw polygon regions on the image!

This could be useful for labeling objects or defining regions on a map.

Add the following line to the `<body>` section of your `index.html`, which adds an empty `div` element to hold our visualization. **Make sure** this comes **before** the `<script>` tag so that the code runs after the `div` is created.

```
<div id='visualization'></div>
```

Next modify `index.js`. The first line should require our cat picture, and also assign it to a variable:

```
var picture = require('cat-picture')
```

We actually just want the source data for the picture, so get it, then remove the image from the page.

```
var src = picture.src
picture.remove()
```

Now install a visualization module for drawing polygons by typing `npm install lightning-image-poly --save`.

Double check that your `package.json` has a new entry!

Require the module by adding the line:

```
var image = require('lightning-image-poly')
```

Then render the image data we stored above by creating a new `image` visualization.

```
var viz = new image('#visualization', null, [src], {hullAlgorithm: 'convex'})
```

If you run `electron app.js` you should see a cat, and be able to draw polygons on it with the mouse!
